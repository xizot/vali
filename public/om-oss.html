                        No we are not a fashion company. We sell razors and accessories for it. But the fashion market is filled with options to suit the individual, there are a plethora of alternatives, including color, size and fabric and much more. However, for men's skin
                        care and shaving, there have never really been alternatives. Although we all have different types of hair growth and skin. Some of us have a rough beard, some curly and others have a thin outer skin layer and sensitive skin, and
                        so all combinations between, add to the diverse climate different individuals live in. VÃ¡li Co. was founded to really offer an alternative to this overlooked target group. A target group that in different populations can be up
                        to four out of five people.

                        For perhaps a whole century, the global shaving market was dominated by only one company with over 70% market share. In just the last five to ten years, their share has fallen to almost half (Euromonitor). The global market for shaving products has only
                        decreased by 5-10% during this time. It's no wonder when you assume that everyone is born the same and even that we all have an equal wallet.

                            We examined markets and countries far away from Sweden. We discovered, for example, that in countries in Asia such as India, or countries in the Middle East, there is not a company that holds a monopoly position. It has even historically and repeatedly
                            tried to penetrate the market with its one-size-fits-all mentality. Just to be quickly dismissed. We understood that in these countries men often have a rough beard growth, maybe a little curly and maybe even sensitive skin.
                            They also may not have as large a wallet as we in the West. Like us, they understood that the option offered did not work for them.

                            At the same time, the development of classic wet shaving products has gone a long way. We took the best we could find and combined it with the new to really offer an alternative. With double razor blades sharp enough to cut even the roughest of hair friction-free
                            without jerking and pulling, state-of-the-art shaving brush made with soft synthetic fibers without the need for any animal to lose life, shaving cream that is saponified without drying out the skin and aftershave that moisturizes
                            and repairs for drying out and burning. And best of all, these skin care shaving products are environmentally friendly. The razor blades can be recycled, the shaving creams contain no chemical environmental dehydration and
                            dehydration propellants, and the aftershave is free from alcohol.
